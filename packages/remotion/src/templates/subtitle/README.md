Plan

- trancriptions as scentences & words.
- transformer that converts transcription to childrenData ()
- layout should be configurable

- VerticalLayout prints words or groups of words in vertical mode, (
  type: "fit-widith" | "left-align" | "riight-align";
  )
- RandomiseLayout prints words or group of words at random positions (
  sizeRandomness,
  positionRandomneess
  )
- animation can be at the word level or at the scentence level or at both levels. (use presets with configurable params, if not given, auto calulated from timestamps )
